# finding-prime-numbers
This program takes a positive integer from user and stores it in variable n.Then, for loop is executed which checks whether the number entered by user is perfectly divisible by i or not.The for loop initiates with an initial value of i equals to 2 and increasing the value of i in each iteration. If the number entered by user is perfectly divisible by i then, isPrime is set to false and the number will not be a prime number. But, if the number is not perfectly divisible by i until test condition i &lt;= n/2 is true means, it is only divisible by
1 and that number itself which means the given number is a prime number.
